All Value in Redis is by default string. Redis does not support Number. but we can use some build in function to treat the value as string.

Example: 
```
SET counter 0
>> OK

GET counter
>> '0'
```

### INCR Command
Increase the value by one.
```
INCR counter
>> 1
```

### DECR Command
Decrease the value by one.
```
DECR counter
>>
```

### INCRBY Command
```
INCRBY counter 4
>> 
```

#### DECRBY Command
```
DECRBY couner 2
>> 
```
